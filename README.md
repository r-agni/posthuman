# Posthuman: Personal Family Interaction and Asset Management AI

Posthuman is an advanced AI-driven system designed to assist with personal family interactions, future event planning, digital asset management, and posthumous account execution. It leverages cutting-edge technologies and operates entirely on local storage to ensure data privacy and security.

## Features

### Personal Interaction and Memory Preservation
- **Private and Public Memory Pools**: Integrates data from private and public memory sources for personalized interaction (e.g., friends/family memory pools).
- **Family Interaction Chatbot**: Uses Mistral AI to enable meaningful conversations based on user-provided data.
- **Future Event Messages**: Auto-generates and sends messages for important events using:
  - **Deep Fake Video**: Personalized video creation.
  - **AI Audio Recording**: Authentic voice replication using ElevenLabs.
  - **Speech and Lip Synchronization**: Realistic animation using Luma for positioning and Muse Talk for lip-sync.
- **Digital Memorialization**: Creates personalized video messages to memorialize an online presence for loved ones.

### Data Sources
All data and analysis are stored locally for enhanced privacy. Sources include:
- Text messages, photos, and emails.
- Cloud accounts and storage (e.g., Drive, personal cloud profiles).
- Financial statements and password managers.
- Cryptocurrency wallets and blockchain data.
